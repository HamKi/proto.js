roadmap: only for project author
purpose of this project:
   it's pirmery for myself, i don't care about communtiy around this project.
   it's shiuld be small and easy for use.
   there is no need for web api like underscore or prototype, source code is enough
       specially that this is for myself and is a small project.

i use first prototype source it will be sufficent for the ads project then for
 mardomsara i will add underscore api.
so prototype version 0.5 plus underscore version 1.0

=======
testing
i will use prototype testing for version 0.5
and for version 1.0 i will add (only modify-not rewrite) underscore test too.

=======
sprockets
i will read it today
file structure should be simple and sprockets should only compact them nothing
 more.
